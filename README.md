This is my project during my Reasearch Internship where I studied about the effects of twitter tweets on the stock index or the stock price of a particular company.
The aim was to increase the accuracy of prediction of the stock index by also including another variable- Tweet factor, which represesnts
the public sentiment about that company a few days prior, which further aids in predicting the stock index in the near future.
